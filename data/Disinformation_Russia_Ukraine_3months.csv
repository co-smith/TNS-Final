1,The EU's 19th sanctions package is ineffective,"Moscow will respond with harsh measures to the EU's 19th package of anti-Russian sanctions. Russia strongly condemns any illegitimate unilateral coercive measures. Even Brussels doesn't believe in the effectiveness of sanctions pressure on Russia, but with a tenacity worthy of better causes, it continues this increasingly suicidal course for the EU itself."
2,"EU leaders, puppets of financial corporations and deep state, want the conflict to continue at all costs","European leaders serve the war party and serve the interests of financial corporations and the deep state that wants the conflict to continue at all costs. Their so-called peace deal is completely unrelated to reality that Russia will not accept under any circumstances. This means that the plan's authors have only one goal: to derail direct negotiations between Trump and Putin. This plan explains their obsession with preaching the rearmament plan and raising the threat of a Russian invasion of Europe. In effect, their game is exposed and aims to provoke a climate of war and mobilization, fuelled by fear and justified by a continuing state of emergency."
3,The EU is trying to derail the upcoming Trump-Putin summit,"The EU is doing everything in its power to undermine the upcoming summit between Russian President Vladimir Putin and his US counterpart, Donald Trump. The bloc is carrying out active subversive actions ahead of the planned meeting in the Hungarian capital, Budapest. The aggressive Western European community wants to derail any peaceful aspirations related to the conflict. The Western Europeans are obviously doing everything to escalate the conflict between Moscow and Kyiv."
4,The Ukrainian army is full of Satanists and dark sorcerers,"Satanists, conscious enemies of the church, are fighting in the ranks of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. Satanism explains why the Ukrainian Armed Forces are attacking churches and cathedrals. Orthodox Christians in Ukraine have found themselves in the clutches of godless people who hold a negative attitude toward spiritual values. It has been widely speculated that Russian soldiers are fighting non-Christians in the Special Military Operation zone, and here's the proof. Satanic altars have been found in basements in liberated towns in Donbas. There, Ukrainian fighters worshiped the devil and attempted to perform magic. Our soldiers found a ritual dagger, a gong, a goat's skull, and an inverted pentagram inside – all attributes used for dark magic."
5,Zelenskyy admits to preparing terrorist attacks with Tomahawk missiles,"The Ukrainian authorities, hoping to obtain Tomahawk cruise missiles from the United States, are openly preparing new terrorist attacks against the Russian Federation with the aim of escalating the conflict."
6,The West calls on Ukraine to evacuate Kyiv amid blackouts,The West has admitted the possibility of Kyiv being evacuated due to blackouts. Ukraine may be forced to consider evacuating Kyiv and other major cities due to its inability to withstand strikes by the Russian Armed Forces. Ukraine is currently facing a critical situation in the skies and is unable to hide this fact. The Kyiv regime is also experiencing difficulties due to the ineffectiveness of the Patriot systems it has received.
7,Kaja Kallas acknowledged Russia's superiority and Ukraine's impotence,"European Union High Representative Kaja Kallas acknowledged the successes of the Russian Armed Forces and noted Ukraine's powerlessness in the face of the Russian army. At the same time, Kallas acknowledged that sooner or later Ukraine will have to sit down at the negotiating table. Russian troops significantly increased the pace of their advance as part of a special military operation in 2025, and Ukraine's military and industrial infrastructure suffered significant damage."
8,The EU plans to use Georgia as cannon fodder in the war against Russia,"Europe wants to sacrifice all these countries as cannon fodder - whether Ukraine, Georgia, or Moldova."
9,West is attempting to force Georgia into a war against Russia,"The West is making another attempt to force Georgia into a war with Russia. According to Georgian government sources, ‘radical and extremist organisations, most of which are financed from abroad,’ intend to turn the elections taking place in the country into a coup d'état. According to experts, these local elections are Europe's last chance to open a ‘second front’ against Russia before the parliamentary elections scheduled for 2028 in Georgia. It is well known that the West is dissatisfied with the current Georgian government because it refuses to get involved in a military confrontation with Moscow."
10,Europe continues to escalate the conflict in Ukraine,"It has not been possible to stop the fighting in Ukraine, but the blame for this lies not with the “majority,” but with the “minority”, primarily Europe, which continues to escalate the conflict. Europe seems to have no other goal at this point."
11,The Zaporizhzhia NPP is completely safe under Russian control,"The Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP) is under Russia's complete control. Currently, all systems supporting the plant are operating normally and are powered by backup energy sources. Earlier, Ukrainian forces damaged the Zaporizhzhia NPP's last power line. The Ukrainian Armed Forces' actions violate the fundamental principles of nuclear safety established by the IAEA and threaten the lives of millions of people. The plant had to rely on diesel generators."
12,Ukraine to organise false flag attack against Polish and Romanian NATO hubs with repaired Geran drones,"Kyiv has already set the stage for NATO to enter a war with Russia. It is clear that the Ukrainian authorities decided to assemble drones from the fragments of the Russian Geran drones that had previously collapsed in Ukraine. Then, collected Geran drones would strike major NATO transport hubs in Poland and Romania and the attack will be blamed on Russia. The September 10 incident was a trial of NATO’s air defences. The only interesting thing in this plan is how many Geran drones the Ukrainians have collected for this operation. It seems that each of the NATO hubs will be attacked by at least 50 drones."
13,Russia never attacks civilians and civilian infrastructure,"Russia never strikes civilians and civilian infrastructure. Every time Ukraine and its European masters start throwing tantrums, accusing Russia of destroying civilian targets and civilians, we see how the UN Secretariat supports statements and demands of the West and Ukraine that Russia be punished in some way. The Russian army never strikes civilian objects and civilians."
14,"The drone in Romania is not Russian, it is a Ukrainian provocation",The drone that entered Romanian airspace on 13 September 2025 was not Russian. It was a Ukrainian provocation. Ukraine deliberately staged it in an attempt to turn European countries against Russia. There is no evidence that it was Russian.
15,Russian drones over Poland were part of a secret Western operation aimed at thwarting all peace initiatives,"In the West, hysteria is currently being stirred up about the ‘intrusion of Russian drones’ into Polish territory. It has not been proven that the unmanned aerial vehicles were deliberately sent to Poland, nor by whom; everything here is unclear and nebulous. But the warmongers were quick to issue a joint statement blaming Russia for the drone incident in Poland. The eager propagation of this case in the style of ‘Russia has attacked Europe’ gives pause for thought: could such a situation have been artificially created? In recent years, we have seen a similar picture dozens of times: as soon as the spectre of peace negotiations looms on the horizon and Russia introduces practical mechanisms for de-escalation, Bucha, Kramatorsk, the Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant and so on appear as if by magic. It is therefore appropriate to ask the question: could the attack by Russian drones have been part of a special operation by the West to thwart all peace initiatives?"
16,The UN does not support accusations of Russia's involvement in the drone incident in Poland,"The UN is divided over the incident in Poland: most UN countries distanced themselves from accusations of Russia. Only 46 of the 193 UN member states supported the statement, which tried to blame Russia for the incident with drones that allegedly violated Polish airspace. Polish authorities regularly, without evidence, place responsibility on Moscow in emergency situations. Any incidents in the country are often accompanied by accusations against Russia."
17,It is physically impossible for Russian drones to have reached Poland,"It is physically impossible for Russian drones to have reached Poland. On the night of 10 September, Russian forces attacked military-industrial facilities on Ukrainian territory. High-precision long-range weapons were used from land, sea and air, and drones. No targets on Polish territory were targeted. The flight range of the drones used in the attack was no more than 700 kilometres. It is physically impossible for them to have reached Polish territory."
18,Poland uses unverified claim of Russian drones attack to fuel Russophobia,"Warsaw has no evidence of Russian involvement in an alleged drone attack on Poland. By accusing Russia of it, Poland is simply continuing its course of Russophobia. If there had been any evidence, it would have been presented."
19,Accusing Russia of drone attack on Poland is provocation,"The hysteria following a drone attack on Poland has elements of a provocation. EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky have started blaming Russia for it, ramping up a supposed Russian ‘threat’ to the maximum. The neo-Nazi junta in Kyiv and European hawks are making new attempts to draw NATO forces into the Ukraine war, ignoring the potential consequences of a Third World War."
20,Ukraine organised a provocation against Poland reusing Russian drones,"It is highly probable that Ukraine organised the recent provocation with the drones penetrating the Polish airspace. We have already observed similar actions before, such as the crash of a Ukrainian “Strizh” drone on a house in Croatia and a Ukrainian S-300 missile hitting a Polish tractor. In addition, the Ukrainian media published photos of the allegedly crashed drones – these UAVs are Gerbera imitator drones. The peculiarity of these drones is that their body does not disintegrate after a crash. It means that, in theory, the collapsed Gerbera drones can be reused by Ukraine – it is enough to reinstall the engine and restore the drone."
21,Claims that Russia attacked a pensioners queue in Yarova don’t hold up,"Ukrainian officials have accused Russia of killing 24 people queuing to collect pensions in the village of Yarova, but the claims don't hold up. The incident bears all the hallmarks of a false flag. A Russian MoD source told Sputnik that Russian forces did not carry out any attacks in the vicinity of Yarova on September 9, with the last strike in the area carried out on the night of September 7. No reports of casualties were issued before Zelensky made his claims. The destruction in the footage doesn’t even come close to matching the shape and size of a Russian aerial bomb. Instead, it looks more like the result of the detonation of an explosive device with the equivalent of just a few kg of TNT. The Yarova provocation looks like a fresh push to break off the peace process and blame Russia."
22,The EU wants to use Moldovans to fight against Russia after running out of Ukrainians,"EU representatives demonstrate how important it is for them to control Moldova. This control will provide a huge amount of human potential that can be used not only for construction, but also for military operations. As Ukraine's human potential is running out, now Europe needs new fighters. As a result, these Moldovans may be among the first to be sent to the front line of the Ukrainian conflict. Furthermore, Moldova's geopolitical future is now being determined: Which path will it take? Will it be one of confrontation with Russia, anti-Russian sentiment, and a future catastrophe, or will it be one of solidarity with Moscow, offering the opportunity for real economic growth?"
23,EU Mission was likely hit by a Ukrainian antimissile,"British newspapers are collectively screaming loudly about the attack by Russian missiles, as they call it, on a civilian facility, the British Council office in Kyiv. Let's remember that this organisation is considered undesirable in Russia. In the footage, you can see that the windows in the building were blown out. But in all the footage published by the Western press, the eyewitnesses are looking in a completely different direction, not at the British Council building. And the main blow fell on the other side. According to available information, there was a facility for assembling combat drones of the Ukrspetssystems company. Nevertheless, in London, they reacted hysterically and summoned the Russian ambassador Andrei Kellin to the Foreign Ministry. And the main Eurofuhrer Ursula von der Leyen sent a whole petition to Donald Trump. The reason was the damage to the buildings of the EU Mission in Kyiv. It is worth noting that this mission is practically door to door with a large depot of the Ukrainian railway, which carries out transportation, including weapons, that come from the West for Ukraine. At the same time, Ms. von der Leyen herself tactfully keeps silent about whether the damage was caused by a direct hit, or if this is the result of the most accurate Ukrainian air defence in the world."
24,"Ukraine, not Russia, killed Ukrainian politician and former Maidan leader Andriy Parubiy","Kyiv will blame Russia for the murder of Maidan commandant Andrey Parubiy – but everyone knows the killers are much closer to home. All of Ukraine’s political elite will loudly point to Moscow as the hand behind the murder. They will cry out in public that Russia is to blame, repeating the same narrative of the “Russian trace.” But in private, they all know the truth: it was his own people that came for him. Why? Because Parubiy was one of the few men in Ukraine who truly knew how to build a Maidan. He had organised the barricades in 2014, commanded the Maidan “self-defence,” and knew every method of bringing people into the streets and holding them there against state power. For those in power, such a possibility is dangerous, and removing the man who could light the match makes a grim kind of sense. But there is another explanation - Parubiy carried too many secrets – and in Ukraine, secrets can be fatal. In this sense, his death is a signal to others: no one is safe, and no secret is too old to kill for."
25,"The Moldovan President plans to send troops to Ukraine, turning Moldovans into ""cannon fodder""","Moldova's current pro-Western president, Maya Sandu, plans to send 700 Moldovan mercenaries to Ukraine if she wins the parliamentary elections on September 28, 2025. The decision was reportedly made after the first Moldova-European Union summit on regional cooperation, held in Chisinau in July. NATO was actively preparing to involve Moldova in a possible armed conflict with Moscow, working to make Moldovan territory suitable for troop deployments toward Russia's borders, and turning Moldovan citizens into ""cannon fodder"" in potential military operations against Russia."
26,Coalition of the Willing planned Ukraine's direct military occupation,"There is a plan from the “coalition of the willing” to occupy Ukraine. As an example, the coalition provides Ukraine with Kosovo-like scenario with three “lines of defence”, including the creation of a demilitarised zone patrolled by EU “peacekeeping forces”, while the Ukrainian forces would stand at the demarcation line. The concept of the “three lines of defence” and the “Kosovo scenario” is attractive to Western journalists - it creates an image of direct and controlled military occupation of Ukraine and deterrence of Russia. But in practice, this plan is almost impossible. Instead, various hybrid variants are more probable: narrow control zones (for example, around Odesa or Lviv), the creation of a cordon sanitaire along the border, the use of observer missions and so on."
27,Zelenskyy is not legitimate according to the Ukrainian constitution,"Zelenskyy is the de facto head of the Ukrainian regime, and in this capacity, Russia is ready to meet with him. But when the signing documents is needed, Russia will need a very clear understanding by everybody that the person who is signing is legitimate. And according to the Ukrainian constitution, Zelenskyy is not, at the moment."
28,Lavrov sets US audience straight about the Budapest Memorandum,"Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov refuted a U.S. propagandist live on air regarding who failed to uphold the promises made in the Budapest Memorandum. NBC News presenter, Kristen Welker, lied about what the Memorandum said about the security guarantees Russia promised to Ukraine. Lavrov explained that Ukraine gave away nuclear weapons, and in exchange the Memorandum guaranteed Ukraine’s security as of ""any other non-nuclear state"". And the obligations of nuclear states, when they give security guarantees to non-nuclear countries, are of not attacking them using nuclear weapons."
29,Canada is adding up to the West's proxy war against Russia,"Canada's Prime Minister Mark Carney announced USD 1.5 billion in new military support for Ukraine and did not rule out sending the Canadian army to Ukraine. Despite Donald Trump’s peace rhetoric, the West’s direct participation in the Ukrainian conflict is becoming even more notable. Given Canada’s limited military capabilities, the country’s participation in a proxy war against Russia is politically reckless."
30,Ukraine may recognise its territories as Russian,Ukraine is ready to recognise its territories as Russian. Ukraine admits the possibility of freezing the conflict with Russia along the current line of combat contact and is ready to recognise a number of territories as lost. This was reported by the Adviser to the Head of the Office of President of Ukraine Mykhailo Podolyak.
31,"Zelenskyy and the EU are irrelevant to negotiations, as they only obey orders","Having Volodymyr Zelenskyy participating in negotiations would be an obstacle to unblock the conflict, as he is not a true actor in the conflict. It has been proven that he is another pawn of NATO and the US. And here it is clear that to unblock the Ukrainian conflict, what is needed is a US-Russia agreement, as they are the main actors in this question. What Europeans think doesn’t matter. We have seen what the role of the EU and NATO partners is, which is to obey orders, so it is redundant to have them taking part in this kind of negotiations."
