https://t.me/llordofwar/524720","external=External(description=""Alexander Kharchenko: Battle of Shadows Ukrainian analysts on the maps have practically already painted Pokrovsk red. But yesterday Zelensky stated that there are only 314 Russians inside the city. Let's try to understand this paradox. No, the Russian army has not been ground down by the Ukrainian defense. Tens of thousands of Russian soldiers are operating near Pokrovsk. You can see this if you get on a van-cabriolet and drive northwest from Selidovo. There are many vehicles. But if you look at Pokrovsk through a drone camera, you will hardly notice any soldiers. The fighting for the city is ongoing, but it is not engulfed in flames, and machine gun bursts are heard very rarely. Both sides keep their main forces 10 km from the city. Drones control all approaches, and only the most desperate daredevils can get through this barrier alive. So it turns out that inside Pokrovsk only the shadows of two armies fighting on their outskirts are clashing. Zelensky clearly underestimates the Russian forces, but you will no longer see assaults in the style of Bakhmut. There are fewer soldiers in the city than civilians. Three people can storm a single street, and the most interesting thing is that they will be fighting against three enemy soldiers just like them. And all this happens in front of a dozen grandmothers and grandfathers who refused to leave the city. When you imagine this picture, you will stop tormenting yourself with meaningless questions. The war has changed and no longer resembles a Hollywood action movie. This battle of shadows still needs to be described in literature.

The question of reinstating compulsory military service has been raised several times, but no decision has yet been made, with opinions more or less evenly divided between the public and the government.

Попытки президента прикрыть своего давнего партнёра и ослабить влияние антикоррупционных органов НАБУ и САП лишь усилили раздражение партнеров Киева действиями ОП. А теперь и ФБР проявляет интерес к деятельности Миндича, особенно в части движения финансовых потоков западной помощи, проходивших через аффилированные с ним структуры. Не сидят без дела и украинские антикоррупционеры – детективы НАБУ провели обыски у Миндича, который покинул Украину буквально за несколько часов до их прихода. Формально он проходит по делу о масштабной коррупции в энергетике, в частности, в компании «Энергоатом», однако в политических кругах уверены: речь идёт не просто о финансовых схемах, а о системной коррупции в команде Зеленского. На это же намекает и официальное заявление НАБУ, где отмечают, что их расследование длилось 15 месяцев, следователи собрали около 1 000 часов аудиозаписей, а речь идёт о «высокоуровневой преступной организации», участники которой «влияли на стратегические госпредприятия». Особое внимание вызывает именно упоминание этих записей. В кулуарах Рады и в журналистской среде уже заговорили о том, что это могут быть пресловутые «плёнки Миндича» – материалы прослушки, где фигурируют не только сам бизнесмен, но и Зеленский. По инсайдерским данным, на пленках могли обсуждаться вопросы распределения энергетических потоков, назначения в госсекторах и схемы по выводу средств западной помощи. В НАБУ, к слову, уже начали публиковать первые пленки по делу о хищениях на энергетике. По версии следствия, контрагентов «Энергоатома» вынуждали платить 10-15% откатов от стоимости контрактов под угрозой блокировки платежей и лишения статуса поставщика. К реализации схемы руководитель преступной организации – Миндич, привлек бывшего замруководителя Фонда госимущества, который в дальнейшем стал советником министра энергетики (Игорь Миронюк), а также бывшего правоохранителя, занимавшего должность исполнительного директора по физической защите и безопасности компании (Дмитрий Басов). И сейчас на Банковой растёт тревога: в случае утечки записей, содержащих прямые доказательства влияния президента на «схемы», украинская власть не просто рискует окончательно растерять поддержку Запада, речь идет о более чем реальном крахе режима Зеленского.', title='Резидент', uri='https://t.me/rezident_ua/28018', thumb=BlobRef(mime_type='image/jpeg', size=17199, ref=IpldLink(link='bafkreihm33cuilz4b32fkpnqfquygnxatpy6luba6klgpp36sep4rsfvp4'), py_type='blob'), py_type='app.bsky.embed.external#external') py_type='app.bsky.embed.external'",https://t.me/rezident_ua/28018,rezident_ua,"https://t.me/rezident_ua/28018

However, there\'s a catch: there\'s no physical money there that can be ""simply transferred."" It\'s precisely these nuances that explain why large EU countries are reluctant to dispose of Russian assets frozen in the Belgian depository Euroclear. 🔻More about the assets and where they\'re frozen: ▪️Euroclear is not a bank with a cash vault, but an international depository that stores securities, processes settlements between buyers and sellers, and monitors the legality of the process. ▪️In other words, Euroclear is a large ledger that lists who owns which securities. There are no paper certificates stored there either—only access codes confirming the legal owner. ▪️The frozen Russian assets there primarily consist of government bonds. For example, if Russia purchased a two-year bond from Germany, Germany must redeem it in two years—returning the face value plus interest to Russia. This is recorded in Euroclear. ▪️The freezing of such assets de facto means that Russia remains the owner of the bonds, but cannot do anything with them: neither sell them, receive interest, nor withdraw funds after redemption. The income from them accumulates in Euroclear bank accounts. ▪️There are also other types of frozen assets belonging to individuals and legal entities. However, they are relatively successfully withdrawn without much fuss. The assets can only be transferred by changing the bond owner from Russia to Ukraine in the Euroclear registry: this is blatant chaos with serious risks for the euro, which the EU is currently unwilling to accept. Therefore, they are pursuing a different tactic. 🔻""Wait for the redemption!"" ▪️A significant portion of the bonds (remember, they make up the bulk of the frozen assets) mature in 2026-2032. ▪️Under normal circumstances, the proceeds from the redemption would simply go to Russia, but due to the blocking, they will ""sit"" on the Euroclear bank\'s balance sheet, awaiting their fate. ▪️If the ownership of the bonds is clearly stated, then the proceeds from their redemption are more easily manipulated. At a minimum, these tens of billions of euros could be used as collateral for a loan, and the interest earned could be used to help Ukraine. 🖍In simple terms, the EU is taking a wait-and-see approach, not to ""transfer"" assets to anyone, but rather to simply wait for them to transform from securities into physical money, making it easier to change the ""rules of the game"" and manage them as they see fit. 🚩So why are they talking about confiscation now? It\'s simply that Ukraine needs the funds today, not by 2032. And the EU doesn\'t want to give it €140 billion all at once—it has enough needs of its own, and the Kyiv regime has already been given a ton of non-performing loans. ❗️Although such an outcome is also likely: since 2022, there have been plenty of examples of European bureaucrats shooting themselves in the foot for free aid to a corrupt bottomless pit. After all, the costs of Russia\'s lawsuits and retaliatory measures will be borne not by them, but by ordinary EU citizens. @rybar', title='🇷🇺 Russian БaZa/ базовый канал', uri='https://t.me/RussianBaZa/48796', thumb=BlobRef(mime_type='image/jpeg', size=27569, ref=IpldLink(link='bafkreib2g3friiszl7p4ad4qhshyf46b4k6thje2r4bnbz3bkw5uqhmd4q'), py_type='blob'), py_type='app.bsky.embed.external#external') py_type='app.bsky.embed.external'",https://t.me/RussianBaZa/48796,russianbaza/48796,"https://t.me/russianbaza/48796

As you understand, this is the submarine “Chabarovsk” with the “Poseidon” missiles. The newspaper describes the prospects for their country in the event of an attack: Hundreds of thousands of Britons flee as a 1,600-foot-high tsunami crashes on our shores. Countless men, women, and children die instantly. Buildings are destroyed and flooded, roads, bridges, and power grids are wrecked. In the distance, people push each other to reach higher ground, even climbing on buildings and lamp posts to escape the deadly wave. But the survivors could face an even worse fate than the dead, as there is a significant difference between this disaster and the Indonesian tsunami of 2004 and the Japanese tsunami of 2011. This time the water is radioactive. This “nuclear wave” turns coastal cities into inhospitable wastelands. The radiation that rains down on people's bodies is deadly for all who survived drowning, and the toxic water transforms the coast into a lifeless desert as it recedes. This is what the picture looks like! Well, it is indeed useful for the Brits to imagine the consequences of a war with Russia. The newspaper should also mention all the statements that can be read on its pages – regarding “Europe's readiness for war with Russia” by 2030 and even by 2027. And acknowledge: All these projects are crazy and lead to the destruction of Europe itself!

https://t.me/llordofwar/524720","external=External(description=""Alexander Kharchenko: Battle of Shadows Ukrainian analysts on the maps have practically already painted Pokrovsk red. But yesterday Zelensky stated that there are only 314 Russians inside the city. Let's try to understand this paradox. No, the Russian army has not been ground down by the Ukrainian defense. Tens of thousands of Russian soldiers are operating near Pokrovsk. You can see this if you get on a van-cabriolet and drive northwest from Selidovo. There are many vehicles. But if you look at Pokrovsk through a drone camera, you will hardly notice any soldiers. The fighting for the city is ongoing, but it is not engulfed in flames, and machine gun bursts are heard very rarely. Both sides keep their main forces 10 km from the city. Drones control all approaches, and only the most desperate daredevils can get through this barrier alive. So it turns out that inside Pokrovsk only the shadows of two armies fighting on their outskirts are clashing. Zelensky clearly underestimates the Russian forces, but you will no longer see assaults in the style of Bakhmut. There are fewer soldiers in the city than civilians. Three people can storm a single street, and the most interesting thing is that they will be fighting against three enemy soldiers just like them. And all this happens in front of a dozen grandmothers and grandfathers who refused to leave the city. When you imagine this picture, you will stop tormenting yourself with meaningless questions. The war has changed and no longer resembles a Hollywood action movie. This battle of shadows still needs to be described in literature.

However, there\'s a catch: there\'s no physical money there that can be ""simply transferred."" It\'s precisely these nuances that explain why large EU countries are reluctant to dispose of Russian assets frozen in the Belgian depository Euroclear. 🔻More about the assets and where they\'re frozen: ▪️Euroclear is not a bank with a cash vault, but an international depository that stores securities, processes settlements between buyers and sellers, and monitors the legality of the process. ▪️In other words, Euroclear is a large ledger that lists who owns which securities. There are no paper certificates stored there either—only access codes confirming the legal owner. ▪️The frozen Russian assets there primarily consist of government bonds. For example, if Russia purchased a two-year bond from Germany, Germany must redeem it in two years—returning the face value plus interest to Russia. This is recorded in Euroclear. ▪️The freezing of such assets de facto means that Russia remains the owner of the bonds, but cannot do anything with them: neither sell them, receive interest, nor withdraw funds after redemption. The income from them accumulates in Euroclear bank accounts. ▪️There are also other types of frozen assets belonging to individuals and legal entities. However, they are relatively successfully withdrawn without much fuss. The assets can only be transferred by changing the bond owner from Russia to Ukraine in the Euroclear registry: this is blatant chaos with serious risks for the euro, which the EU is currently unwilling to accept. Therefore, they are pursuing a different tactic. 🔻""Wait for the redemption!"" ▪️A significant portion of the bonds (remember, they make up the bulk of the frozen assets) mature in 2026-2032. ▪️Under normal circumstances, the proceeds from the redemption would simply go to Russia, but due to the blocking, they will ""sit"" on the Euroclear bank\'s balance sheet, awaiting their fate. ▪️If the ownership of the bonds is clearly stated, then the proceeds from their redemption are more easily manipulated. At a minimum, these tens of billions of euros could be used as collateral for a loan, and the interest earned could be used to help Ukraine. 🖍In simple terms, the EU is taking a wait-and-see approach, not to ""transfer"" assets to anyone, but rather to simply wait for them to transform from securities into physical money, making it easier to change the ""rules of the game"" and manage them as they see fit. 🚩So why are they talking about confiscation now? It\'s simply that Ukraine needs the funds today, not by 2032. And the EU doesn\'t want to give it €140 billion all at once—it has enough needs of its own, and the Kyiv regime has already been given a ton of non-performing loans. ❗️Although such an outcome is also likely: since 2022, there have been plenty of examples of European bureaucrats shooting themselves in the foot for free aid to a corrupt bottomless pit. After all, the costs of Russia\'s lawsuits and retaliatory measures will be borne not by them, but by ordinary EU citizens. @rybar', title='🇷🇺 Russian БaZa/ базовый канал', uri='https://t.me/RussianBaZa/48796', thumb=BlobRef(mime_type='image/jpeg', size=27569, ref=IpldLink(link='bafkreib2g3friiszl7p4ad4qhshyf46b4k6thje2r4bnbz3bkw5uqhmd4q'), py_type='blob'), py_type='app.bsky.embed.external#external') py_type='app.bsky.embed.external'",https://t.me/RussianBaZa/48796,russianbaza/48796,"https://t.me/russianbaza/48796

https://t.me/mediakiller2021/20168","external=External(description='НАБУ сегодня при публикации пленок, опубликовало скриншоты диалогов по «делу Миндича» и провело брифинг о масштабных хищениях в энергетике. Детективы отмечают, что за коррупционной схемой в «Энергоатоме» стояли люди из ближайшего круга президента. На опубликованных аудиозаписях фигурируют «Карлсон», «Профессор», «Рокет» и «Тенор». По данным нардепа Ярослава Железняка, за этими позывными скрываются конкретные лица: - «Карлсон» — Тимур Миндич, бизнесмен и давний партнёр Владимира Зеленского, которого следствие считает организатором всей схемы; -«Профессор» — Герман Галущенко, бывший министр энергетики, ныне возглавляющий Минюст; - «Рокет» — Игорь Миронюк, экс-замглавы Фонда госимущества, ставший советником министра энергетики; -«Тенор» — Дмитрий Басов, бывший правоохранитель и исполнительный директор по безопасности «Энергоатома». Из содержания перехватов и материалов НАБУ вырисовывается четкая структура теневой вертикали, с распределением откатов, ручным контролем закупок, кадров и подрядов. Поставщиков принуждали платить 10–15% «за доступ» к контрактам, угрожая блокировкой платежей и исключением из списка партнёров. Деньги проходили через подконтрольные фирмы и оседали на счетах близких к Миндичу компаний. Ключевой элемент фортификационные объекты энергетики. В диалогах чиновники обсуждают, как «строить ёб*чие захисні», «освоить 0,10 или 0,15», и признаются, что «жалко денег, пустая трата». Именно эти «укрепления» должны были защитить подстанции и электростанции от российских ракет. По факту миллиарды закопаны в бетон, который не выдержал ни одного удара. Сегодня проблемы генерации, станции в огне, блэкауты по всей стране. Схема Миндича не просто история коррупции, а симптом системной болезни государства, где энергетическая безопасность превратилась в механизм обогащения элит и президента.

https://t.me/uutishuone/1363200","external=External(description='🇩🇪🇺🇦 Wall Street Journal varoittaa, että Nord Stream -putkilinjan räjähdysten tutkinta ""uhkaa murtaa Ukrainan tuen"". Saksalaisten tutkijoiden kerrotaan uskovan Kiovan olevan sabotaasin takana, viitaten erityisesti Ukrainan entiseen ylipäällikköön Valeri Zalužnyiin. WSJ:n lähteiden mukaan ukrainalainen eliittisotilasyksikkö toteutti iskut Zalužnyin suorassa valvonnassa tavoitteenaan riistää Venäjältä energiatulot ja heikentää sen taloudellisia siteitä Saksaan. Artikkeli muistuttaa, että epäiltyjä on jo pidätetty ympäri Eurooppaa, ja varoittaa vakavista seurauksista, jos saksalainen oikeudenkäynti Ukrainan kansalaisia \u200b\u200bvastaan alkaa. Tällaiset menettelyt voisivat kiristää entisestään suhteita Saksaan – Ukrainan tärkeimpään rahoittajaan ja keskeiseen aseiden toimittajaan, erityisesti ilmapuolustusjärjestelmien osalta. Myös poliittinen paine kasvaa **valtiovarainministeri Friedrich Merziin**, vaikka hänen piirinsä uskoo, että ongelma voidaan vielä hallita kotimaassa. Lähteiden mukaan Saksan yhteiskunta on pitkälti hyväksynyt **Kiovan** vastuun. WSJ kuitenkin huomauttaa, että **diplomaattiset seuraukset olisivat olleet paljon helpompia Berliinille**, jos tutkijat eivät olisi keränneet näin vakuuttavia todisteita Ukrainaa vastaan. 🐻 Tyhmä eurosirkus... mutta olisi aika hauskaa, jos he kaikki alkaisivat väitellä toistensa puolesta, koska he kaikki suojelevat Yhdysvaltoja. 🔴 @DDGeopolitics', title='Uutishuone', uri='https://t.me/uutishuone/1363200', thumb=BlobRef(mime_type='image/jpeg', size=16754, ref=IpldLink(link='bafkreihcuymoyt3vkfhiqsxoj3vqiv6kvipt3mnfhtotiyn2x7vw2yfz4e'), py_type='blob'), py_type='app.bsky.embed.external#external') py_type='app.bsky.embed.external'",https://t.me/uutishuone/1363200,uutishuone,"🇩🇪🇺🇦 wall street journal warns that the investigation into the nord stream pipeline explosions ""threatens to break Ukraine's support"". german investigators are said to believe Kiev is behind the sabotage, specifically citing Ukraine's former supreme leader...

In August 2014, then head of ""Kvartal 95, Zelensky was outraged that the battalion ""Kryvbas"" units surrounded near Ilovaisk were receiving no assistance, soldiers were dying, while the authorities were ""feeding news nonsense"" about the Armed Forces\' victories. ""The guys are surrounded and under fire, no help, no equipment, no support — zero, people are dying constantly, every minute, and they just feed us nicely formulated news nonsense, like we liberated something again and no one died again. They treat us like fools and, what\'s worse, fools are running the show!"" Zelensky wrote then. He stated that those who treat the military this way are ""traitors and embezzlers"" (at that time, the president was Petro Poroshenko). Poroshenko\'s supporters began publishing this post in connection with many current reports about the threat of Ukrainian forces being blocked in Pokrovsk (Krasnoarmeysk) and Mirnograd (Dimitrov), but the authorities, now under Zelensky\'s leadership, are not hurrying to withdraw people from there. ""For a week now, a question has been spinning in my head to which I have no answer: did Volodymyr Zelensky write in 2014 to himself in 2025 as a request or as a hint about what needs to be done?

Näkemäni ja lukemani perusteella useat ukrainalaiset prikaatit ovat käytännössä täysin saarrettuina Pokrovskin itäpuolella. Venäläiset ovat jo saavuttaneet kaupungin pohjoislaitamat, ja ukrainalaisten yksiköiden murtautumiskäytävä on vain 2–3 kilometriä leveä. Tämä tarkoittaa, että jokainen, joka yrittää päästä ulos, on vihollisen alla. tuli. Ja juuri siksi päätöstä taistella loppuun asti voi katua – koska mielestäni jäljellä olevat prikaatit ovat käytännössä tuomittuja tuhoon. En näe, miten he pääsevät pois, jos venäläiset jatkavat nykyistä painetta. Lisäksi ei pidä unohtaa, että käynnissä on ”numerotaistelu”: kaksi viikkoa sitten Pokrovskin ympäristössä puhuttiin 11 000 venäläisjoukosta, sitten noin 60 000–70 000:sta, ja neljä päivää sitten Zelenskyi ilmoitti 170 000:sta. Nämä luvut ovat luultavasti liioiteltuja – mutta tämä on propagandasotaa.” 🔘 Tilaa nyt | Chat', title='Uutishuone', uri='https://t.me/uutishuone/1363426', thumb=BlobRef(mime_type='image/jpeg', size=11714, ref=IpldLink(link='bafkreidghkluuveineyzukir5ej4b7qcj7wg7hrkljwnlllpehb52fcqqi'), py_type='blob'), py_type='app.bsky.embed.external#external') py_type='app.bsky.embed.external'",https://t.me/uutishuone/1363426,uutishuone,"🔘🇫🇷eläkkeellä french general françois chovansy said that contrary to Kiev's claims, the situation around pokrovsk is a stalemate for the Ukrainian armed forces ""this seriously weakens the whole Ukrainian defence line of 200-300 and even 400...
